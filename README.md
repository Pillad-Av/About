# About Us
We are Pillad Av, a Swedish-based multi-gaming community 
that loves to play and have fun together.

We host our own servers in games such as CSGO, rust, and minecraft, 
where we offer a variety of features and settings to suit different preferences and playstyles.



## Here are some of the highlights of our game servers:

**CSGO**: We have a discord bot that can handle everything related to csgo-inhouse events, also known as 10man. The bot can balance teams, move users to the correct discord channels, and provide statistics. The bot can also facilitate tournaments with the same features. Our csgo server is ideal for players who want to practice their skills and compete with other members in a friendly and fair environment.


**Rust:** We have a 2x server, which means that the resources and loot are doubled. The server also has some quality of life changes and some loottable changes, which could make the gameplay more enjoyable and balanced. Our rust server is perfect for players who want to explore, build, and survive in a challenging and rewarding world.


**Minecraft:** We have a vanilla server, which means that the game is played as it was originally intended by the developers. The server has no plugins or mods that alter the gameplay or add new features. Our minecraft server is great for players who want to experience the classic and authentic minecraft adventure.


*We also have a discord server where we chat, hang out, and organize events and tournaments. Whether you are looking for a casual or competitive gaming experience, you will find a friendly and supportive environment here at Pillad Av. Join us today and become part of our growing family!*
